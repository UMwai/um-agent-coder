   - Support for multiple API providers
   - Model selection based on task complexity

4. **Planning Stage**
   - Yes, extensive planning through project analysis
   - Creates mental model of codebase structure
   - Plans approach before execution

### Unique Features
- Checkpoint system for workspace state
- Human-in-the-loop approvals
- Custom tool creation on-the-fly
- Browser interaction for full-stack development

## OpenCode Analysis

### Core Architecture
- **Model**: Multiple AI provider support (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)
- **Interface**: Terminal-based TUI with Bubble Tea
- **Storage**: SQLite for persistent conversation history

### Key Efficiency Patterns
1. **Auto-Compaction**
   - Automatic conversation summarization at 95% context usage
   - Seamless session creation to prevent context overflow
   - Intelligent context preservation

2. **Integrated Development Tools**
   - Built-in file manipulation commands
   - LSP integration for code intelligence
   - Vim-like editor for quick edits

3. **Cost Optimization**
   - Multiple low-cost model support
   - Configurable token limits
   - Provider-specific optimizations

4. **Planning Stage**
   - Minimal upfront planning
   - More reactive/interactive approach
   - Quick task execution focus

### Unique Features
- Non-interactive mode for automation
- Named arguments for custom commands
- External editor support
- TUI for better user experience

## Cost-Effectiveness Algorithm

### Proposed Formula

```
Cost_Effectiveness = Task_Completion_Rate / (Token_Cost + Time_Cost)

Where:
- Task_Completion_Rate = (Successfully_Completed_Tasks / Total_Attempted_Tasks) * Task_Complexity_Score
- Token_Cost = Total_Tokens_Used * Price_Per_Token
- Time_Cost = Human_Intervention_Time * Hourly_Rate
- Task_Complexity_Score = weighted average of:
  - Lines of code changed (0.3)
  - Number of files affected (0.2)
  - Integration complexity (0.3)
  - Debug/test requirements (0.2)
```

### Optimization Strategies

1. **Context Efficiency**
   - Load only necessary files
   - Use search/grep before full file reads
   - Implement smart summarization

2. **Model Selection**
   - Use cheaper models for simple tasks
   - Reserve expensive models for complex reasoning
   - Implement task classification

3. **Batch Operations**
   - Group similar operations
   - Minimize API calls
   - Cache common queries

## Recommendations for UM-Agent-Coder

### High Priority Improvements

1. **Implement Context Management**
   - Add AST parsing for better code understanding
   - Implement context window tracking
   - Add auto-summarization capabilities

2. **Enhanced Tool System**
   - Add file search capabilities (glob/grep)
   - Implement browser automation
   - Add checkpoint/rollback system

3. **Cost Tracking**
   - Implement token counting
   - Add cost estimation before execution
   - Track success/failure rates

### Medium Priority Improvements

1. **Planning Module**
   - Add project structure analysis
   - Implement task decomposition
   - Create execution strategy before starting

2. **Multi-Model Support**
   - Add support for multiple LLM providers
   - Implement model selection logic
   - Add fallback mechanisms

3. **User Interface**
   - Consider TUI implementation
   - Add progress indicators
   - Implement approval workflows

### Implementation Algorithm

```python
class EnhancedAgent:
    def execute_task(self, prompt):
        # 1. Planning Stage (15-20% of time)
        task_analysis = self.analyze_task(prompt)
        project_context = self.analyze_project_structure()
        execution_plan = self.create_plan(task_analysis, project_context)
        
        # 2. Context Loading (10% of time)
        relevant_files = self.identify_relevant_files(execution_plan)
        context = self.load_optimized_context(relevant_files)
        
        # 3. Execution Stage (60-70% of time)
        for step in execution_plan:
            result = self.execute_step(step, context)
            if result.requires_more_context:
                context = self.expand_context(result.needed_info)
            self.track_progress(step, result)
        
        # 4. Validation Stage (10% of time)
        self.validate_changes()
        self.run_tests()
        self.calculate_cost_effectiveness()
```

## Conclusion

The most efficient AI coders share these characteristics:
1. **Smart context management** - Loading only what's needed
2. **Planning before execution** - Understanding the task fully
3. **Cost awareness** - Tracking and optimizing token usage
4. **Tool integration** - Rich set of development tools
5. **Failure recovery** - Checkpoints and rollback capabilities

The UM-Agent-Coder can significantly improve by implementing these patterns, particularly in context management and planning stages.
