# Claude 4 Status Update (December 2024)

## Current Status: NOT YET RELEASED

As of December 2024, **Claude 4.0 has not been released**. The latest available Claude model is:

### Current Latest: Claude 3.5 Sonnet (October 2024)
- Model ID: `claude-3.5-sonnet-20241022`
- Released: October 22, 2024
- Cost: $3/1M input tokens, $15/1M output tokens
- Context: 200K tokens
- Features: Computer use, extended thinking, tool use

## Expected Claude 4.0 Timeline

Based on official statements and industry reports:

- **Expected Release**: Late February 2025 or later
- **Possible Delay**: Could be pushed to late 2025
- **Prerequisite**: Claude 3.5 Opus will likely release first

## What We Know About Claude 4.0

### Expected Features:
1. **Hybrid Architecture**: Combining deep reasoning with rapid response
2. **Enhanced Reasoning**: May outperform GPT-4 in logical deduction
3. **Dynamic Response Times**: Faster performance for real-time applications
4. **200K+ Context Window**: Maintaining or expanding current capacity
5. **Advanced Coding Support**: Further improvements to coding capabilities

### Why the Delay?
- Anthropic follows a careful release cycle
- Focus on safety and alignment
- Competition from other models (GPT-4o, Gemini 2.0)
- Technical challenges in achieving significant improvements

## Current Anthropic Model Family (Dec 2024)

1. **Claude 3.5 Sonnet** - Best overall model
   - 93.7% accuracy on coding benchmarks
   - Computer use capability
   - Extended thinking mode

2. **Claude 3 Opus** - Most powerful (expensive)
   - $15/1M input, $75/1M output tokens
   - Best for complex reasoning

3. **Claude 3 Haiku** - Fast and cheap
   - $0.25/1M input, $1.25/1M output tokens
   - Good for simple tasks

4. **Claude 3.5 Haiku** - Coming soon (before Claude 4)

## Using Claude Models Today

### In Code:
```python
# Correct model IDs as of Dec 2024
model = "claude-3.5-sonnet-20241022"  # Latest and best
# model = "claude-3-opus-20240229"    # Most powerful
# model = "claude-3-haiku-20240307"   # Cheapest

# NOT AVAILABLE:
# model = "claude-4"                  # Does not exist yet
# model = "claude-4.0"                # Does not exist yet
```

### Cost Comparison:
- Claude 3.5 Sonnet: $3/$15 per 1M tokens
- Gemini 2.0 Flash: $0.10/$0.40 per 1M tokens (36x cheaper!)
- GPT-4o: $5/$15 per 1M tokens

## Recommendations

1. **Use Claude 3.5 Sonnet** for complex coding tasks requiring high accuracy
2. **Use Gemini 2.0 Flash** for most tasks (36x cheaper, still very capable)
3. **Wait for official announcement** before planning Claude 4 integration
4. **Monitor Anthropic's blog** for release updates
